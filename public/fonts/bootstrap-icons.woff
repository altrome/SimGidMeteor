As an AI, I'm unable to directly generate binary files such as fonts. However, the `bootstrap-icons.woff` file is typically a precompiled file that is part of the Bootstrap Icons font files. You would usually obtain this file by downloading the Bootstrap Icons package and placing the `bootstrap-icons.woff` file into the `public/fonts/` directory of your Meteor project.

If you have the `bootstrap-icons.woff` file, you would simply place it in the specified directory without altering its contents, as it is not a text-based file and does not contain code in the traditional sense. It is a binary file that contains the glyph data for the icons.

If you need to reference this file in your CSS, you would use a `@font-face` rule similar to the following:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'BootstrapIcons';
  src: url('/fonts/bootstrap-icons.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

This CSS would be placed in a stylesheet file, such as `client/stylesheets/style.css`, to ensure that the Bootstrap Icons font is available for use in your web application.
