As an AI language model, I'm unable to generate binary files such as `.woff2` font files directly. These files are typically binary data and are not created through code but rather through font design software or downloaded from a font provider.

For the `public/fonts/bootstrap-icons.woff2` file, you would need to download the Bootstrap Icons font file from the official Bootstrap Icons repository or use a package manager to include it in your project. Once you have the file, you would place it in the `public/fonts/` directory of your Meteor project.

If you have the Bootstrap Icons package installed, the `.woff2` file would be included automatically, and you would not need to manually add it to your project. If you need to include it manually, you would download the file from a trusted source and save it to the specified directory without altering its contents.

Since I cannot provide the binary content of the file, here is how you would reference it in your CSS after placing it in the correct directory:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'BootstrapIcons';
  src: url('/fonts/bootstrap-icons.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

Please ensure you have the correct licensing and permissions to use Bootstrap Icons in your project.
